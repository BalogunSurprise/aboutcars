    <ol><b>THE 2024 MERCEDES BENZ E-CLASS</b></ol>


    <!-- This is a paragraph tag  -->
     <p>THE 2024 MERCEDES BENZ E-CLASSis executive transport with a distinctly Mercedes-Benz attitude, offering nearly as much class and substance as the S-class flagship with a slightly less imposing profile. Entry-level E350 models are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder powertrain with 255 horsepower while E450s turn up the heat to 375 horsepower courtesy of a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. Both powertrains deliver good punch and surprisingly good fuel economy. All-wheel drive is standard, and all models come luxuriously equipped and include a generous list of driver-assistance and infotainment features—some of which are more gimmicky than useful. Other European rivals like the Audi A6 and the BMW 5-series offer similar space and equipment but neither brand has quite the prestige that comes with a Mercedes-Benz badge. </p>
